# Static-Website-Hosting-in-S3
In this project, I set out to host a static website using AWS services such as S3, CloudFront, and Route 53. The website will be securely delivered via CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN), and accessed using a custom domain managed in Route 53. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) will handle SSL certificates, ensuring the website is served over HTTPS for secure communication.
The project will be done using AWS Management Console.
